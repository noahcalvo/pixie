Hello and welcome to the Pixie project. <br/>
The vision is to create a verbose skeleton project that can be used to jumpstart app ideas. <br/>
This will save time that would usually be spent initializing React, Express, nodeJS and Mongo, as well as setting up a test suite.<br/>
As the project continues to grow, I hope to add more features such as:

- an authentication suite
- a deployment pipeline
- hosting instructions
- a sample README. Bon voyage!

## Hosting Instructions

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/ and create a Firebase project
2. In the Firebase console, click to set up a web app (towards the bottom of the screen). It will walk you through installing Firebase in your project, and configuring it in your `index.js`. Replace the existing logic with your own configuration values.
3. Enabling Google Auth - navigate here: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/piixie/authentication/providers and under "sign-in method" enable Google.
4. Make sure you have firebase cli installed (`npm install -g firebase-tools`) and then login from your command line with `firebase login`
5. In the apps root directory, run `firebase init`
6. Select hosting options. For a MERN stack app with authentication, you'll likely only need Firebase Hosting. I also set up Github actions for deployments.
7. Run `npm run build` and then `firebase deploy`. Now you should see the app at the domain provided by Firebase!!
   <br/>
   <br/>
Boom.
